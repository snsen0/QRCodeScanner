# QR Code Scanner

This React Native code aims to initiate a QR code scanner through a button. When the user clicks the button, the application opens a QR code scanner. Upon scanning a QR code, it prints the scanned data to the console and closes the camera. The QR code scanner is integrated using the react-native-camera and react-native-qrcode-scanner libraries.



## Installation

```sh
npm i
npm i react-native-camera
npm i react-native-qrcode-scanner
npm i @ethersproject/shims
npm start
```
